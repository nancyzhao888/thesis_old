### Musical Theatre: Life Beyond Broadway
Broadway musical theatre is not a ephemeral and New York local phenomenon. It is a powerful brand, and a form of cultural export, which through international touring and international productions, has created a global network of audience. However, while eyes and ears are on the 40 theatres on the Great White Way, the theatre industry has hardly examined this  mechanisms of international business and Broadwayâ€™s cultural impact.

This visualization uses weekly Broadway performance data from the Broadway League and international touring data from [...] to follow the trajectories of [how many] Broadway musical titles through [time] and across continents to see the dynamics of cultural transmission, and more importantly to understand the motivation behind this global distribution. The areas of questions I aim to address are -
* Understanding **global distribution** 
  * When was a show on Broadway?
  * Where and when did it go after that?
  * What was its distribution pattern across the globe over time?
* Understanding **timing** 
  * _Timing of market emergence_: When did a certain market emerge in the international touring network?
  * _Timing of title popularity_: When did a title become popular to an international market?
* Understanding **what motivated the global distribution** 
  * Does success on Broadway mean success abroad?
  * Does musicals of book or film adaptation increase familiarity and in turn popularity of the title aboard?
  * Does international touring drive more global distribution or local language version of Broadway titles?
  * Other qualitative attributes could include: female/male lead cast; genre/themes

The research aims to discover a better way for producers and authors of Broadway shows to branch out into foreign markets, for presenters to more effectively assess the competitive landscape and market interest.
