> Broadway musical theatre is not a ephemeral and New York local phenomenon. It is a powerful brand, and a form of cultural export, which through international touring and international productions, has created a global network of audience. However, while eyes and ears are on the 40 theatres on the Great White Way, the theatre industry has hardly examined this  mechanisms of international business and Broadwayâ€™s cultural impact.

> This visualization follows the trajectories of [how many] Broadway musical titles through [time] and across continents to see the dynamics of cultural transmission, and more importantly to understand the motivation behind this global distribution. Where did a title originate and where did it go after or during its Broadway run? Does success on Broadway mean success abroad? Does book or film adaptations generate more appeal in the foreign markets? What markets are more welcoming of Broadway musicals and where is still untapped?

> The research aims to discover a better way for producers and authors of Broadway shows to branch out into foreign markets, for presenters to more effectively assess the competitive landscape and market interest.
