> Broadway musical theatre is not a ephemeral and New York local phenomenon. It is a form of cultural export, which through international touring and international productions, has created a global network of audience. This visualization follows the trajectories of these Broadway musical titles through time and across continents to see the dynamics of cultural transmission. Where did a title originate and where did it go after its Broadway run? What motivated this global distribution? Does success on Broadway mean success abroad?
